# purrr package

purrr enhances Râ€™s functional programming toolkit (read: the apply family of functions) by providing a complete and consistent set of tools for working with functions and vectors

best place to start is the family of `map()` functions which allow you to rep0lace many for loops* with code that is more succinct and easier to read

`map()` functions transform their input by applying a function to each element and returning a vector the same length as the input

.footnote[[*] And much much more]
